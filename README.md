# CapsNet-NLSTM-ITS
A framework for network-level traffic forecasting is also proposed by sequentially connecting CapsNet and NLSTM.An experiment on a Beijing transportation network with 278 links shows that the proposed framework with the capability of capturing complicated spatiotemporal traffic patterns outperforms multiple state-of-the-art traffic forecasting baseline models.   
The data we use: "Train_data.7z","Test_data.7z","goal_test.7z","goal_train.7z"   
we use Github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras to  bulid the capsnet
